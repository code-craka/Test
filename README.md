Hey there! I'm Sonia Akter Simla, a passionate coding enthusiast and a student at the Independent University of Bangladesh (IUB). I love diving into the world of code, always ready to tackle new challenges and bring ideas to life through programming. You can find my coding adventures on GitHub under the username "code-craka." Whether it's a complex project or a fun side gig, I'm all about turning imagination into reality, one line of code at a time. Let's code and create something amazing together!
